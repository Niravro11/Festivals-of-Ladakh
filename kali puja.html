	The Losar festival goes on for a month during which the Gods, deities, ancestors and even animals are fed scrumptiously prepared food. It is celebrated as the New Year two months ahead of the Tibetan New Year. In the early 17th century, King Jamyang Namgyal decided to lead an expedition against the Baltistan forces in winter; therefore he decided to celebrate the festival two months before.
